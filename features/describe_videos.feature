Feature: describe videos

  As a volunteer
  So that I can provide audio descriptions for my friends
  First of all I want to find videos via a valid YouTube URL
  Then I want to add AD to them

    Given I can access the following YouTube videos:
        | Title       | yt_video_id |

Scenario: enter a valid URL to describe

    When I am on the home page

    And I fill in "yt_url" with "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40z9n1SgozU"
