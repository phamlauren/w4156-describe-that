Feature: see list of users

  As a TA
  So that I can grade this project
  I want to see the list of users

Background: users in databse

    Given the following users exist:
    | id | username    | auth0_id | options                |
    | 1  | vishnu.nair | asdffdsa | {"default_lang": "en"} |
    | 2  | xw2765      | fdsaasdf | {"default_lang": "en"} |
    | 3  | lyp2106     | jkl;;lkj | {"default_lang": "en"} |

Scenario: see list of users
  And I am on the home page
  And I go to the Users index page
  Then I should see "lyp2106"

#   As a random Internet surfer

#   I want to log into describe-that

# Background: users in databse

#   Given the following users exist:
#   | email                    | password          | options                |

#   | lyp2106@barnard.edu      | thisIsMyPassword! | {"default_lang": "en"} |

# Scenario: create myself as a user
#   When I go to the new user page
#   And I fill in the "email" field with "lauren.pham@columbia.edu"
#   And I fill in the "password" field with "thisIsMyPassword!"
#   And I press "Create"
#   Then I should be on the Users index page
#   And I should see "lyp2106@barnard.edu"

# Scenario: log in (happy path)
#   When I go to the user login page
#   And I fill in the "email" field with "lyp2106@barnard.edu"
#   And I fill in the "password" field with "thisIsMyPassword!"
#   And I press "Log in"

#   And I press "Log in"
