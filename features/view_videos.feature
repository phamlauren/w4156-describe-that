Feature: view videos

  As a person with visual impairments
  So that I can understand a video with more context than its sound
  I want to find videos with audio descriptions

Background: existing YouTube videos

    Given I can access the following YouTube videos:

Scenario: search and find the video I want

Scenario: access audio descriptions for the video I found (happy path)

Scenario: request audio descriptions for the video I found (sad path)
